# Vapor

The Vapor extension provides an interface to redirect URLs. 

Installing Vapor is as easy as any other Radiant extension. Add it to your Gemfile with:

    gem "radiant-vapor-extension"

And then (after `bundle install`) add the database tables:

    rake radiant:extensions:vapor:migrate

See the HELP_admin.md for more details.
